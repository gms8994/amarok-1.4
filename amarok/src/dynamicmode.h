 * Infiltrations of Dynamic Mode                                           *
 *   Dynamic mode is a complex playlist handling mechanism - acting        *
 *   basically on the concept of a 'rotating' playlist.  The playlist can  *
 *   be modelled as a queuing system, FIFO.  As a track is advanced,       *
 *   the first track in the playlist is removed, and another appended to   *
 *   the end.  The type of addition is selected by the user during         *
 *   configuration.                                                        *
 *                                                                         *
 *   Due to the nature of this type of handling, the status of dynamicmode *
 *   must be determined, as many function require alternate handling.      *
 *      Examples include:                                                  *
 *          - Context Menus                                                *
 *          - Double clicking on an item -> requires moving the item to    *
 *            front of the queue                                           *
 *          - Undo/Redo states, to reinit history items                    *
 *   Please be aware of these when working with dynamic mode.              *
