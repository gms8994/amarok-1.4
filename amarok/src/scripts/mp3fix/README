<p>
<b>About:</b><br>
Mp3Fixer is a script for repairing MP3 files which display a bogus track length or bitrate in your
audio player.
</p>
<p>
For example, if you have a track that you know is really <i>five minutes</i> long, but
Amarok shows the length as <i>one hour</i>, then this script is for you. Mp3Fixer calculates the
real track length and adds the missing XING header to the file. Additionally, Mp3Fixer is capable
of repairing broken MPEG header frames.
</p>
<p>
It is recommended that you <i>back up</i> your MP3 file before using this script on it. Although the
script is designed not to harm your file, the operation is not reversible and should therefore
be used with caution.
</p>

<p>
<b>Usage:</b><br>
Select a track in the playlist, then start Mp3Fixer from the context-menu (right mouse click).
</p>
<p>
It is also possible to use Mp3Fixer as a command line tool, by calling the mp3fix.rb script
contained in this package. mp3fix.rb only requires Ruby to be installed, not Amarok.
The Mp3Fixer Amarok Script is a frontend for this tool.
