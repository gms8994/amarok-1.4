<div align="center"><b>DatabaseScripts (v0.2)</b></div>

<p>
<b>About:</b><br>
DatabaseScripts is a collection of scripts for general manipulation of the amarok collection
database.  Currently, there are two scripts in the bundle.
</p>

<p>
<b>Backup Collection:</b><br>
Specify the target directory in the configuration dialog, and the database will be copied to
the specified directory.  This will work for SQLite or MySQL database backends.  If you are 
interested in extending this to support Postgresql, it would be appreciated!
</p>

<p>
The backup will be saved as collection.db.date for sqlite, or amarokdb.mysql.date with mysql
databases.
</p>
<p>
<i>Note:</i> For mysql users, it is necessary to give the database user all 
database action permissions.  This is required for mysqldump.  This can be achieved by issuing
the following command:
<blockquote>
  $> mysql -u root -p<br>
  mysql> GRANT ALL ON amarokdb.* TO amarok@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'xxxx';
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<b>Optimise Database:</b><br>
This script will remove all entries in the database which do not exist in the filesystem.
</p>
<p>
<i>Warning:</i> Just to say I told you so, please use the <i>Backup Collection</i> script prior to
executing this script.
</p>

<p>
<b>Notes:</b><br>
If you would like to write any additional scripts, or have any suggestions, please email them to me
so i can include them in the release!
