<div align="center"><b>Amarok Live</b></div>

<b>About:</b><br>
This script lets you create your own Amarok live! cd with music on it. It is very simple to use: click configure, and choose the iso as well as a temporary work directory. Clicking ok will start the unpacking, and when it is done, you can add music to the cd by selecting tracks and using the right click menu.<br>
<br>
When you are done selecting tracks, click Create Remastered CD. the iso will be created in the work dir that you selected during configure.<br>
<br>
<b>Dependencies:</b><br>
A kernel with squashfs as either a module or compiled in.<br>
squashfs-tools (see NOTE below)<br>
cdrtools (for mkisofs)<br>
Python 2.2<br>
PyQt<pr>
1.5 gb of free space<br>
Original Amarok live! iso<br>
K3b (optional) for automatic burning<br>
<br>
<b>License:</b><br>
GPL V2<br>
<br>
<b>Note:</b><br>
If you are using the amarok_live-1.3.iso cd, (not amarok_live-1.3-update1.iso) then you will not be able to remaster successfully unless you are using squashfs-tools version 2.1. Version 2.2 will create a cd that cannot boot. Please make sure to downgrade, or download the updated version of the iso. An xdelta (binary patch) is available too instead of the full iso.<br>
