# ============
# This script installs the current development (SVN) version of Amarok on your computer.
# If you've run it once, and then run it again, it will update your version of Amarok and only compile the new files.
#
# Made by Jocke "Firetech" Andersson.
# Idea and inspiration from a small script by Greg "oggb4mp3" Meyer.
