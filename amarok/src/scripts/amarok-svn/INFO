This bash script (not for Amarok itself) installs the current development version of Amarok (from SVN) on your computer.

There will be a later version (4.0, I guess) written in ruby (maybe python) instead of bash, that version will probably be split into smaller parts
to make the
script able to update itself on each run. That's the main reason why I put it in the SVN repository (besides making others able to change it, that
is...)

For now, use the stable version if you want reliability. It's available at http://amarok.kde.org/amarokwiki/index.php/AmaroK-svn
