<div align="center"><b>Graph Equalizer by Ian Monroe</b></div>
<b>About:</b><br>
Idea comes from an aRTs plugin; it's an equalizer that works by plotting and dragging
points on a graph. Gives a lot more control in fewer clicks. I'm releasing it as a
"script"  with the idea of integrating it into Amarok 1.3 after user feedback.<br>
<br>
<b>Using:</b><br>
Just click 'Run' in the Script Manager and the equalizer will open. To
open the dialog again click 'Configure.' Points are added by double clicking on the
line. The equalizer settings take affect once you release the point from a drag.<br>
<br>
<b>TODO:</b><br>
*delete points<br>
*remember settings between runs<br>
