.TH AMAROK 1 "Feb 2008" "Amarok" "An audio player for KDE"
.SH NAME
amarokapp
\- A direct executable for Amarok.
.SH SYNOPSIS
amarokapp [Qt-options] [KDE-options] [URL(s)] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
Amarok is a multimedia player based on the soundserver-independent framework.
There are many media players around these days, true. What's missing from most
players is a user interface, that doesn't get in the way of the user.
.P
This is direct Amarok executable. The recommend way to run Amarok is using
\fBamarok(1)\fP, which is a wrapper script around \fBamarokapp\fP. However, if you're
debugging Amarok with gdb, valgrind or similar program, you will probably want to
run it against this binary directly.
.P
\fBamarokapp(1)\fP takes the same command line options and arguments as
\fBamarok(1)\fP. See its manual page for more information how to run \fBamarokapp\fP.
