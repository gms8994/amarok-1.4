Amarok packages for Debian
==========================

  A couple of notes which you may find useful:

    - starting with Amarok 1.4, lyrics downloading is implemented in a
      separate Ruby script;

    - Last.fm stream support is also implemented with the help of a Ruby
      script.

    - if you want amarok to be able to play CDs, you need to install the
      kdemultimedia-kio-plugins package.

    - the scripts available in the 'Scripts' menu need that you install
      some other packages for them to work. Those packages are listed in
      the Suggests: field of the amarok package.

  Also, users not using the full KDE environment may get the following
  error when executing amarok for the first time: "Socket-path is not a
  link or a directory: /home/$USER/.kde/socket-$HOSTNAME". Just execute:

    $ lnusertemp socket

  Note that you only need to execute it once, not each time that you
  start Amarok.
