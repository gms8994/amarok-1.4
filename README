 Amarok - the audio player for KDE
===================================

There are many media players around these days, true. What's missing from most
players is a user interface that doesn't get in the way of the user. How many
buttons do you have to press for simply adding some new tracks to the playlist?
Amarok tries to be a little different, providing a simple drag and drop
interface that really makes playlist handling easy.

 IMPORTANT INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
================================

In order to compile and install Amarok on your system, type the following in the
base directory of the Amarok distribution:


                % ./configure --prefix=`kde-config --prefix`
                % make
                % make install


Note: --enable-final is not guaranteed to work


Packages for popular distributions are available at http://amarok.kde.org

 INSTALLATION-FAQ
==================

Q: Can I improve Amarok's startup time?
A: Prelinking Amarok has spectacular results; however if you have binary openGL
   drivers (eg Nvidia drivers), you will need to compile Amarok --without-opengl
   in order to get the amarokapp binary to prelink (the amarok binary is not
   important here).

 INFORMATION FOR PACKAGERS
===========================

For Amarok packages we suggest you build:

                % ./configure --disable-debug

It is possible to build Amarok to use MySQL as the database backend. Using
MySQL makes the Amarok collection faster.

We suggest compiling Os, there is no particular part of Amarok that would
benefit from optimisation, so the smallest binary is probably the best route.

In order to limit the dependencies the Amarok package demands we suggest
splitting Amarok into the following packages:

   1. Amarok + one backend
   2. xine-engine
   3. Helix-engine
   4. amarok_libvisual
   5. ipod media device
   6. ifp media device
   7. njb media device
   8. mtp media device
   9. rio karma media device

Amarok is modular and will be fully functional as long as one of 2 or 3 is
also installed. Hence we suggest Amarok + one backend. Feel free to include the
helix, MAS and NMM engines if you can satisfy their dependencies.

Amarok ships with two binaries: amarok and amarokapp. The amarok binary is a
wrapper designed to speed up command line argument passing. amarokapp is the
real Amarok.

If you make packages for Amarok please let us know and we'll link to you on the
homepage (as long as you don't object).
